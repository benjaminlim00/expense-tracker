# Expense Tracker App

This repository contains an Expense Tracker app built using React and Tailwind CSS. It was developed as part of a job interview process to showcase my skills in frontend development.

## Technologies Used

The Expense Tracker app is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined styles and utility classes.
- **LocalStorage**: The browser's local storage is used to store and retrieve expense data, allowing for data persistence.
